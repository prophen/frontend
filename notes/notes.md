# Notes

I used yarn instead of npx to initialize create-react-app

`npx create-react-app frontend`

Is what is instructed in the video but it didn't work for me even after uninstalling globally. Maybe, my unistall didn't work. But I followed these directions from the github repo.

> If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

I was able to get up and running with Yarn

`yarn create react-app my-app`
